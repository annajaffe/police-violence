""STATE STATUTES
a. C.R.S. _18-1-707 states in the pertinent part: Use of physical force in making an arrest or in preventing an escape:
1. ""(1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, a peace officer is justified in using reasonable and appropriate physical force upon another person when and to the extent that he reasonably believes it necessary:
a. To effect an arrest or to prevent the escape from custody of an arrested person unless he knows that the arrest is unauthorized; or
b. To defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of physical force while effecting or attempting to affect such an arrest or while preventing or attempting to prevent such an escape.
2. A peace officer is justified in using deadly physical force upon another person for a purpose specified in subsection (1) of this section only when he reasonably believes that it is necessary:
a. To defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force; or
b. To affect an arrest or prevent the escape from custody, of a person whom he reasonably believes:
1. Has committed or attempted to commit a felony involving the use or threatened use of a deadly weapon; or
2. Is attempting to escape by the use of a deadly weapon; or
3. Otherwise indicates, except through a motor vehicle violation, that he is likely to endanger human life or to inflict serious bodily injury to another unless apprehended without delay. (The Denver Police Department policy on use of deadly force in this situation is more restrictive than state law _ see OMS 105.05(5).
...
4. For the purposes of this section a reasonable belief that a person has committed an offense means a reasonable belief in facts or circumstances which if true would in law constitute an offense. If the believed facts and circumstances would not in law constitute an offense, an erroneous though not unreasonable belief that the law is otherwise does not render justifiable the use of force to make an arrest or to prevent an escape from custody. A peace officer who is affecting an arrest pursuant to a warrant is justified in using the physical force prescribed in subsection (1) and (2) of this section unless the warrant is invalid and is known by the officer to be invalid.""
b. The community expects and the Denver Police Department requires that peace officers use only the force necessary to perform their duties. The level of force applied must reflect the totality of circumstances surrounding the immediate situation. The officer need only select a level of force that is necessary and within the range of _objectively reasonable options. Officers must rely on training, experience and assessment of the situation to decide an appropriate level of force to be applied.

1.1.2 Deadly Force: The most serious act in which a police officer can engage is the use of deadly
force. The authority to carry and use firearms in the course of public service is an enormous
responsibility. Respect for human life requires that, in all cases, deadly force be used as a last
resort, and then only to protect an officer or another person from imminent danger of death or
serious physical injury. Officers should use only the minimal amount of force necessary to protect
human life. Where feasible, and consistent with personal safety, some warning, such as
Ã’POLICE-DON'T MOVE,Ã“ should be given. If appropriate, officers should employ non-lethal
alternatives prior to utilizing deadly force. Deadly force is never justified in the defense of property.
Above all, the safety of the public and officers must be the overriding concern whenever the use
of deadly force is considered.

LAST RESORT: Last resort means that all practical methods available to the officer to avoid using
deadly force have been exhausted. Depending on the tactical situation, these methods may
include verbal commands (i.e., Ã’STOP POLICE, OR IÃ•LL SHOOTÃ“) foot pursuit, using a lesser
level of necessary force, establishing a perimeter, etc., when these means can be accomplished
