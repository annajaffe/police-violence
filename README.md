## Current TODO for EDA:

Noah will compile datasets on police department demographics and area demographics, clean datasets, work on merging demographic data with the core Washington Post dataset, and perform preliminary EDA by November 11th.

Anna will recreate and augment plots from the Washington Post article associated with the fatal shootings data, as well as from the “Police violence in the US” Kaggle datasets, to perform preliminary EDA by November 11th.

Kamran will develop interactive geographic visualizations. Will attempt to display preliminary EDA from group members using this framework. Will compile ‘use of force’ policies and expand on the visualizations presented by Washington Post and New York Times by November 11th.

Cindy will compile information on police training and department policy (such as use of body cameras) across the Washington post dataset and BJS police academy datasets, and perform preliminary EDA on the relationship between training/policy and police violence in different geographic regions by November 11th.
